            Growing up, I was always fascinated with technology. Then, in high school 
            I had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of computer programming, 
            starting with C++ and Java. After graduating, I decided to pursue a career 
            in Information Technology, so I enrolled in a technical college. Over the 
            next two years I earned my Associate degree in Computer Support and 
            Networking.

            In 2013, I was hired by the University of Georgia as the IT helpdesk manager 
            for the Facilities Management Division. For the next two years I managed the 
            physical computers, began automating processes with PowerShell, and learned 
            how to maintain our layer-2 network and small VDI environment. Then, in 2015 
            I had the opportunity to move into system administration and continue refining 
            my skills. Since then, I have built up the VDI environment that now services 
            roughly 800 employees for our division, streamlined computer deployments and 
            automated other tasks, managed the layer-2 network for our buildings, and 
            deployed and maintained Palo Alto firewalls to protect our datacenters. 
            Additionally, I spent two years working with Access Control supporting the 
            access control, video monitoring, and related back-end systems for the 
            university.

            Currently, I am also working on obtaining my Bachelor of Information Technology 
            online at Kennesaw State University. My current course work includes web 
            development and hardware & software concepts. I have also completed courses 
            covering Python, C#, and pre-calculus, and have a 4.0 Institutional GPA. My goal
            after graduation is to move into a higher leadership role as an IT Director
            leveraging my experience to guide and inspire a successful team.

            When I&apos;m not staring at firewall logs, optimizing VDI login times, or taking 
            online classes, I enjoy dreaming of having the time to play video games. Speaking
            of games, would you like to play <a href="rps.html">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a>?
